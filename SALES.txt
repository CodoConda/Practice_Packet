				Question 1 - SQL question

        Assuming you have a table called "sales" with the following columns and one row per sale (purchase).
            Customer: text
            Product : text
            Datetime_of_order : timestamp
            Quantity : numeric
            Price_per_item : numeric
        
        Please provide sql that will list the top 10 customers (order the list descending based upon total sale value) 
        only for customers who purchased at least 3 times in the last 6 months, 
        for each customer also show a column with total purchases 
        for the last 3 years, year by year.
        
        Make whatever assumptions you need to (don't come back with any clarifying questions), 
        rough sql is fine it doesn't have to be syntactically correct.
